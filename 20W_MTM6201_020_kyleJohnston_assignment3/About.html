        <p> My name is Kyle Johnston I am a student at Algonquin College. I have always had a passion for design and art. Thats when I decided I wanted to 
            start making my own art. It just so happens my art is through a lense and a screen. I always use to imagin my life as a movie, id stare
            out the window of my car wondering what angle would this look the best at. Then I got really into fashion, started designing my own clothes
            That is when I found my passion for design, from there I design almost daily, decided thats what I wanted to go to school for and have never looked back.
            Thats why I want to work for you, its also why I should work for you. I will always be there to help your buisness with any of their design or
            Photo/video needs, thats because its not just a job for me, its a passion, a life long passion at that.
