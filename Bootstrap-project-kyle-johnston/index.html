                These two men to the left are named Mark Otto and Jacob Thorntonand they devlouped Bootstrap to be a easy webkit tool. They created bootstrap at 
                twitter in 2010. During twitters first ever Hack week event Bootstraps exsploded in popularity! Everyone was shocked that web develoupers
                of all levels hopped on and started using bootstrap with no external guidance. The partners created something amazing and made code accessible
                for programers of all levels! Excited by their success they decided they were going to release Bootstrap to the public so coders across the world
                could jump in and start develouping. Since then Bootstraps has had around 20 diffrent releases. These releases include two major rewrites
                including V2 and V3. These rewrites have giving many new features and streamlined their tool. Now the two partners and their small team of
                9 have all been working on Bootstraps together since day 1. These team continues to work full-time to streamline bootstraps, add more features
                and insure this webkit tool recivies all of the support it needs so it can continue to help all develoupers create the websites of their dreams.

            <div class="col text-center border border-secondary bg-light">
                <h3>Huge List of Components</h3>
                <br>
                <p> If your a season pro at coding you know that components are important, anytime a webkit comes a long you have the right to be conserned
                    about the limitations of said kit. but with Bootstraps I can confidentally say don't worry! Bootstraps has all the compenents and more that
                    you will need to build a beautiful and fuctional website, Some of the components that Bootstraps offers are, Dropdowns, Button Groups

                <h3>Browser Compatibility</h3>
                <br>
                <p> Browsers come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, well not really. But there are tons of different browsers, they range widely and have diffrent platforms
                    Issues with browser can come quick and fast, it quickly becomes frusturating when a entire sections of audience is completly cut off from your website
                    due to a browser incompatibility. Well worry not, you can rest peacefully knowing that Boot straps is Compatible with any browser you can think of!
                    Safari, Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera and many more!

                <h3>State of the Art Grid System</h3>
                <br>
                <p> Grid systems can be very intimidating, it doesn't matter if your a season pro or a beginner a bad grid systems can add hours to your project not to 
                    mention become a huge headache! If im to be honest with you I hate grids myself, I will do eveerything I can do just to avoid using any kind of grid
                    but not with Bootstraps. Bootstraps has a responsive grid system thats boost a 12 column grid layout that is truely idiot proof! With a few basic commands
                    you can make a grid to fit your needs! Trust me if I can do it so can you so.
